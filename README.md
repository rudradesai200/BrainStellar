# Future aspects
- Improve the latex file by fixing all the errors and automating them
- Add puzzles from `https://puzzles.nigelcoldwell.co.uk/`

# Note
- A lot of cleaning needs to be done as the questions and answers are not properly formatted for latex.
- book.tex under `tex` directory contains the corrected version.
- All of it cannot be automated and is out of scope. The code just contains some of the automation.
