  "Question": "Suppose we can roll a 6-sided die up to n times. At any point we can stop, and that roll becomes our 'score'. Our goal is to get the highest possible score, on average. How should we decide when tostop?",
  "Solution": "If $n=1$, there is no decision to make; on average our score is $7 / 2$.\nIf $n=2$, we want to stick if the first roll is greater than 7/2; that is, if it is 4 or greater. Otherwise, we roll again. Thus, with $n=2$, our average score is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) 4+\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) 5+\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) 6+\\left(\\frac{3}{6}\\right) \\frac{7}{2}=\\frac{17}{4}=4.25 .\n$$\nIf $n=3$, we want to stick on the first roll if it is greater than 4.25; that is, if it is 5 or 6 . Otherwise, we are in the $n=2$ case. Thus, with $n=3$, our average score is\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) 5+\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right) 6+\\left(\\frac{4}{6}\\right) \\frac{17}{4}=4.666 \\ldots\n$$\nIn general, if we let $f(n)$ be the expected value of our score with $n$ rolls left, using $s$-sided dice, we have the recursion\n$$\nf(n)=\\frac{\\lfloor f(n-1)\\rfloor}{s} f(n-1)+\\sum_{j=\\lfloor f(n-1)\\rfloor+1}^s \\frac{j}{s}\n$$\nwith $f(1)=(s+1) / 2$."

  "Question": "On average, how many times must a 6-sided die be rolled until the sequence 65 appears (i.e., a 6 followed by a 5)?",
  "Solution": "This appears to be quite similar to problem 2, but there is a difference. In problem 2, once we roll a 6 , there are only two possibilities: either we roll a 6 , or we start all over again.\n\nIn this problem, once we roll a 6 , there are three possibilities: (a) we roll a 5, (b), we roll a 6, or (c) we start all over again.\n\nWe can again solve it using recursion, but we'll need two equations. Let $E$ be the expected number of rolls until 65 and let $E_6$ be the expected number of rolls until 65 when we start with a rolled 6 . Then:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nE_6 & =\\frac{1}{6}\\left(E_6+1\\right)+\\frac{4}{6}(E+1)+\\frac{1}{6}(1) \\\nE & =\\frac{1}{6}\\left(E_6+1\\right)+\\frac{5}{6}(E+1)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThis gives us a system of two linear equations in two unknowns, which we can solve to find\n$$\nE=36, E_6=30\n$$\nSo it takes fewer rolls on average to see a 6 followed by a 5 than it does to see a 6 followed by a 6 ."

  "Question": "Suppose we roll a fair die 10 times. What is the probability that the sequence of rolls is non-decreasing (i.e., the next roll is never less than the current roll)?",
  "Solution": "For example, the sequence ${1,2,2,2,3,4,5,5,5,6}$ is a non-decreasing sequence.\nThe total number of possible roll sequences is $6^{10}$. How many of these are non-decreasing?\nAn excellent observation is that every non-decreasing sequence is equivalent to a 'histogram' or vector which gives the number of times each face appears.\n\nFor example, the sequence ${1,2,2,2,3,4,5,5,5,6}$ is equivalent to the vector $\\langle 1,3,1,1,3,1\\rangle$. By equivalent, I mean that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the sequences and vectors. So, counting one is equivalent to counting the other.\n\nThus, we wish to count how many ways can 10 indistinguishable things be placed into 6 bins, where we allow for zero items to be placed in some bins.\n\nTo count that, we observe that this is equivalent to the number of ways to place 16 indistinguishable things into 6 bins, where each bin must contain at least one item. Subtracting one from each bin will give us a vector of the previous sort.\nTo count this, we can use the stars-and-bars method. Putting 16 things into 6 bins is equivalent to putting 5 bars among 16 stars, such that there is at most one bar between any two stars. For instance, this choice of bars:\n$$\n* * *|* * * * *| * *|*| * * * * \\mid *\n$$\nrepresents the vector $\\langle 3,5,2,1,4,1\\rangle$ which, if we subtract one from each component yields the vector $\\langle 2,4,1,0,3,0\\rangle$ which corresponds to the rolled sequence $1,1,2,2,2,2,3,5,5,5$.\nSince there are 16 stars, there are 15 places for bars, and hence the number of such sequences is\n$$\n\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n15 \\\n5\n\\end{array}\\right)=3003\n$$\n\nGenerally, for a sequence of $n$ rolls, the probability is\n$$\np_n=\\frac{\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn+6-1 \\\n5\n\\end{array}\\right)}{6^n}\n$$"

  "Question": "Suppose a pair of dice are thrown, and then thrown again. What is the probability that the faces appearing on the second throw are the same as the first? What if three dice are used? Or six?",
  "Solution": "We may consider two cases. If two dice are thrown, the result will either be two different faces, or the same face twice. We may notate these two cases as 'AB' and 'AA' (this will be useful later). The probability that two different faces will appear is\n$$\n\\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{6^2}=\\frac{5}{6}\n$$\nand the probability that the second throw will be the same as the first in this case is\n$$\n\\frac{2}{6^2} \text {. }\n$$\nThus, the probability that the second roll will repeat the first in this way is\n$$\n\\frac{6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 2}{6^4}=\\frac{5}{108}\n$$\nThe other possibility of of rolling doubles. This case gives a probability of\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{6}{6^2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{6^2}\\right)=\\frac{6}{6^4}=\\frac{1}{216}\n$$\nof occurring. Adding together, we find the probability of the second throw being identical to the first is\n$$\n\\frac{5}{108}+\\frac{1}{216}=\\frac{11}{216}=0.0509259 \\ldots\n$$"
